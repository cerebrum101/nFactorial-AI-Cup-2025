## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript 
- **Vite** 
- **Tailwind CSS** 
- **Web Speech API** 
- **Vercel** 

**Backend:**
- **FastAPI** (Python) 
- **Groq LLaMA 3.1** for intelligent natural language processing
- **BeautifulSoup + Selenium** for web scraping
- **Pydantic** for data validation and serialization
- **Render.com** for backend hosting

**Key Libraries:**
- `speech-recognition` and `speechSynthesis` 
- `requests` and `selenium` 
- `groq-python` 
- `python-dotenv` 

##  Workflow

### 1. **Smart Query Processing**
When you say something like *"Find me apartments in Istanbul for 3 people under $80 for June 15-20"*, here's what happens behind the scenes:

- **Language Detection:** Determines if this is a search query vs. casual chat
- **Parameter Extraction:** Uses LLaMA 3.1 to intelligently parse:
  - Location: "Istanbul"
  - Guests: 3 people  
  - Budget: Under $80/night
  - Dates: June 15-20, 2024
- **Validation:** Cleans and validates extracted data (handles common speech-to-text errors)

### 2. **Intelligent Search Triggering**
The system uses sophisticated logic to decide when to search:
- **Immediate Search:** Simple confirmations ("yes", "go", "find it")
- **Auto-Search:** When you provide location + any details
- **Confirmation:** Only for very complex requests (10+ words with multiple parameters)

This means less back-and-forth, more results.

### 3. **Real-Time Web Scraping**
We don't use fake data. Ever. When you search, we:
- **Generate Airbnb URLs** with your exact parameters (location, dates, guests, price filters)
- **Scrape Live Data** using a hybrid approach:
  - Primary: Fast `requests` with BeautifulSoup
  - Fallback: Selenium for JavaScript-heavy pages
  - Backup: Direct URL redirection if scraping fails
- **Extract Real Info:** Actual titles, prices, ratings, and booking links

### 4. **Voice-First Experience**
The talk mode isn't just a gimmick‚Äîit's computational efficiency:
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Fixes common speech-to-text errors automatically
- **Smart Turn-Taking:** Knows when you're done speaking vs. pausing
- **Auto-Correction:** "apartment in is tanble for 3 people" ‚Üí "apartment in Istanbul for 3 people"
- **Bilingual Support:** Seamlessly switches between English and Russian

### 5. **Direct Booking Integration**
When you select a property, we generate authentic Airbnb URLs:
- **Message Host:** Direct link to contact the property owner
- **Book Now:** Takes you straight to Airbnb's booking page with your dates pre-filled
- **Secure:** All transactions happen on Airbnb.com for safety

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smart Caching:** Recent searches cached to avoid re-scraping
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple scraping strategies run simultaneously
- **Token Limits:** AI responses capped at 300 tokens for speed
- **Conversation History:** Limited to last 6 messages to reduce processing time

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation:** If advanced scraping fails, falls back to simpler methods
- **Timeout Management:** 10-second fallbacks prevent UI from getting stuck
- **Rate Limiting:** Respectful scraping with delays to avoid being blocked
- **Error Recovery:** Talk mode automatically recovers from speech synthesis interruptions

### Data Accuracy
- **Real-Time Validation:** Prices, availability, and property details are live
- **Parameter Cleaning:** Handles edge cases like "$70 USD per day maximum" ‚Üí max_price: 70
- **Date Parsing:** Supports multiple formats ("June 15-20", "6/15-6/20", "15-20 –∏—é–Ω—è")
- **Guest Validation:** Prevents extraction errors (like confusing prices for guest counts)

### Security & Privacy
- **No Data Storage:** We don't store your search history or personal info
- **Secure APIs:** All AI processing uses encrypted Groq endpoints
- **Direct Routing:** Booking happens directly through Airbnb's secure platform
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive keys stored securely, never in code
